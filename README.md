# Antisocial_Engine

It is a growing project that is windows based and my intention is to make some simple tools that they:

1)Will not be on linux

2)Will be straightforward without a hundred of argparse commands

3)From the start to the beggining will guide the user to type whatever It needs

4)It will have mostly social engineering tools and the most important the user will be able after typing some commands to make his own exe files for use them however he wants(social enginering)

For now I have only the screenshot captor that sends screenshots to your gmail(screenie), the remote keylogger that sends key strokes to your gmail also(keylie) and a dictionary attack for gmail(dictator).
